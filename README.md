# Unity-VR-Gesture-Based-Interaction-System
My final year project tackling Player presence using a gesture-based Non-Player Character (NPC) interaction system in Virtual Reality games.

By creating a dynamic Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) based interaction system, an NPC can imitate temperment during Player-NPC interactions. This project implements such a system using specified Virtual Reality gestures using the AirSig gesture recognition API to detect gestures performed and determine how NPCs should 'feel' and react during interactions in addition to simply using dialogue trees. For example, an NPC would feel anger towards a Player who has previously carried out aggressive gestures during a 'conversation' regardless of whether what the Player was saying resembled the opposite.
